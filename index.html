                    France has always been considered the homeland of quality wines, and the originals of almost all classic wines come from France.
                    Of course there are worthy challengers, who many times are even better, but if you generally look at the range of quality wines, and include both quantity and quality in the assessment, France is in an undisputed urban area.
